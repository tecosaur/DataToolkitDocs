#+title: Creating a new data transformer

As mentioned before, there are three types of data transformer:
- =storage=
- =loader=
- =writer=

The three corresponding Julia types are:
- =DataStorage=
- =DataLoader=
- =DataWriter=

All three types accept a =driver= (symbol) type parameter. For example, a storage
transformer using a "filesystem" driver would be of the type
=DataStorage{:filesystem}=.

Adding support for a new driver is a simple as adding method implementations for
the three key data transformer methods:

load
#+end_src

#+begin_src @docs
storage
#+end_src

#+begin_src @docs
save
#+end_src
