#+title: Data.toml

Data collections are represented on-disk as =Data.toml= files. While =DataToolkit=
can be used at a basic level without any knowledge of the structure of the file,
a little knowledge goes a long way (for instance when =edit=â€‹ing a dataset).

* Overall structure

See the TOML refresher below if you're a bit rusty, then come back to this.

A =Data.toml= file is broadly composed of three sections:
1. Global setup information
2. Configuration
3. Datasets

Here's what that structure looks like in practice:

#+begin_src toml
data_config_version=0

name="data collection name"
uuid="a UUIDv4"
plugins=["plugin1", "plugin2", ...]

[config]
# [Properties of the data collection itself]

[[mydataset]]
uuid="a UUIDv4"
# other properties...

[[mydataset.TRANSFORMER]]
driver="transformer driver"
type=["a QualifiedType", ...]
priority=1 # (optional)
# other properties...

[[mydataset]]
# There may be multiple data sets by the same name,
# but they must be uniquely identifyable by their properties

[[exampledata]]
# Another data set
#+end_src

** Global setup

The global setup must specify:
- The =Data.toml= format version
- The name and UUID of the data collection
- The plugins used by the data collection

** Configuration

The =config= TOML table is special, and is used to hold custom attributes of the
data collection, for example:

#+begin_src toml
[config]
mykey="value"

[config.defaults]
description="Ooops, somebody forgot to describe this."

[config.defaults.storage.filesystem]
priority=2
#+end_src

As a consequence of this, no dataset may be named ="config"=.

** Datasets

All datasets are represented using an /[[https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#array-of-tables][array of tables]]/. This allows multiple
datasets to have the same name, and be distinguished by other attributes (e.g.
version information). All datasets must have a =uuid= key, this is important for
providing a canonical unique reference to a particular dataset.

#+begin_src toml
[[mydataset]]
uuid="a UUIDv4"
# other properties...
#+end_src

The storage/loader/writer transformers of a dataset are specified using
sub-tables, i.e.

#+begin_src toml
[[mydataset.TRANSFORMER]]
driver="transformer driver"
# other properties...
#+end_src

All transformers /must/ set the =driver= key. All attributes other than =driver=,
=type=, and =priority= are free to be used by the transformer and plugins.

* TOML refresher

TOML files are already widely used with Julia (for example, =Project.toml= and
=Manifest.toml=) files, as they strike a good compromise between capability and
complexity. See [[https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0][the TOML documentation]] for a full description of the format, but
here are the components most relevant to =Data.toml= files.

** Key-value pairs

#+begin_src toml
key = "value"
#+end_src

This represents a ="key"= dictionary key having the value ="value"=. Strings,
numbers, booleans, and date/time stamps are all appropriate value forms.

#+begin_src toml
a = "value"
b = 2
c = 3.1e+12
d = true
e = 1979-05-27T07:32:00Z
#+end_src

Arrays are written using =[ ]= syntax, and can spread across multiple lines.

#+begin_src toml
key = [1, 2, 3]
#+end_src

** Tables (Dictionaries)

A collection of key-value pairs within a certain scope form a Julia =Dict= when
parsed. TOML allows for nested dictionaries using /tables/. A new table is created
with a bracketed header line, like so:

#+begin_src toml
[new_table]
#+end_src

All key-value entries after such a table header, up to the next table header,
belong to that table. For example:

#+begin_src toml
[mytable]
a = 1
b = 2
#+end_src

this is parsed as

#+begin_src julia
Dict("mytable" => Dict("a" => 1, "b" => 2))
#+end_src

It is also possible to represent this using dotted keys, e.g.

#+begin_src toml
mytable.a = 1
mytable.b = 2
#+end_src

These two styles can mixed to form nested tables.

#+begin_src toml
[mytable.innertable.deeply_nested]
key = "value"
#+end_src

** Arrays of tables

A list of dictionaries (array of tables in TOML terminology) can be formed using
double-bracketed headers, e.g.

#+begin_src toml
[[table_array]]
#+end_src

All double-bracketed tables will be collected together into an array, for
example:

#+begin_src toml
[[table_array]]
key = 1

[[table_array]]
key = 2
#+end_src

will be parsed as

#+begin_src julia
Dict("table_array" => [Dict("key" => 1),
                       Dict("key" => 2)])
#+end_src
