#+title: Introduction

=DataToolkit= bundles =DataToolkitBase= and =DataToolkitCommon=, and provides a very
thin convenience layer on top.

For details on the fundamental system, see the [[https://tecosaur.github.io/DataToolkitBase.jl/][DataToolkitBase]] docs; for details
on the transformers and plugins available see the [[https://tecosaur.github.io/DataToolkitCommon.jl][DataToolkitCommon]] docs.

In future, this documentation will be expanded with a "quickstart guide" among
other things. The current form is basically a stub.
